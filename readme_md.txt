# Emission Gaming Calculator

An interactive demonstration of how strategic emission factor selection enables "emission gaming" in corporate carbon accounting.

## About

This tool demonstrates the critical gap in current GHG Protocol guidance that enables 'emission gaming' - the strategic selection of emission factors that can artificially reduce reported emissions by up to 6.7 times.

## Features

- **Product Comparison**: Compare emission factors across major LCA databases
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Statistical analysis with confidence intervals
- **Gaming Scenarios**: Conservative, average, and aggressive factor selection
- **Multi-year Projections**: See long-term impact of gaming strategies
- **Statistical Significance**: T-tests, effect sizes, and confidence intervals
